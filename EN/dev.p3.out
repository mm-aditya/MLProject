When #UNK#
I #UNK#
called #UNK#
this #UNK#
morning #UNK#
, #UNK#
I #UNK#
didn't #UNK#
think #UNK#
I #UNK#
would #UNK#
be #UNK#
able #UNK#
to #UNK#
get #UNK#
in #UNK#
at #UNK#
12 #UNK#
, #UNK#
but #UNK#
I #UNK#
was #UNK#
able #UNK#
to #UNK#
get #UNK#
in #UNK#
, #UNK#
along #UNK#
with #UNK#
four #UNK#
other #UNK#
guests #UNK#
. #UNK#

The O
tuna B-positive

Food #UNK#
wise #UNK#
, #UNK#
its #UNK#
ok #UNK#
but #UNK#
a #UNK#
bit #UNK#
pricey #UNK#
for #UNK#
what #UNK#
you #UNK#
get #UNK#
considering #UNK#
the #UNK#
restaurant #UNK#
isn't #UNK#
a #UNK#
fancy #UNK#
place #UNK#
. #UNK#

– #UNK#
tucked #UNK#
away #UNK#
over #UNK#
by #UNK#
the #UNK#
Beverly #UNK#
Center #UNK#
. #UNK#

My #UNK#
mouth #UNK#
felt #UNK#
very #UNK#
dry #UNK#
afterwards #UNK#
and #UNK#
I #UNK#
had #UNK#
that #UNK#
signature #UNK#
? #UNK#
MSG #UNK#
? #UNK#
taste #UNK#
lingering #UNK#
in #UNK#
my #UNK#
throat #UNK#
after #UNK#
I #UNK#
left #UNK#
the #UNK#
restaurant #UNK#
. #UNK#

It's #UNK#
a #UNK#
tiny #UNK#
place #UNK#
so #UNK#
if #UNK#
you #UNK#
get #UNK#
there #UNK#
before #UNK#
8p #UNK#
m #UNK#
on #UNK#
a #UNK#
weekend #UNK#
( #UNK#
Thurs #UNK#
? #UNK#
Sun #UNK#
) #UNK#
you #UNK#
will #UNK#
find #UNK#
it #UNK#
easier #UNK#
to #UNK#
get #UNK#
a #UNK#
table #UNK#
or #UNK#
a #UNK#
seat #UNK#
at #UNK#
the #UNK#
sushi #UNK#
bar #UNK#
. #UNK#

The #UNK#
wine #UNK#
list #UNK#
is #UNK#
wonderful #UNK#
and #UNK#
the #UNK#
food #UNK#
reminds #UNK#
me #UNK#
of #UNK#
my #UNK#
recent #UNK#
trip #UNK#
to #UNK#
Italy #UNK#
. #UNK#

We O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
seafood B-positive
restaurants O
in O
New O
York O
. O

Believe O
it O
baby O

We O
have O
since O

Compared #UNK#
to #UNK#
Ess-a #UNK#
, #UNK#
Tal #UNK#
offers #UNK#
a #UNK#
less #UNK#
doughy #UNK#
bagel #UNK#
! #UNK#

It #UNK#
was #UNK#
so #UNK#
much #UNK#
though #UNK#
that #UNK#
I #UNK#
could #UNK#
barely #UNK#
finish #UNK#
but #UNK#
I #UNK#
did #UNK#
, #UNK#
since #UNK#
it #UNK#
was #UNK#
delicious #UNK#
. #UNK#

the #UNK#
staff #UNK#
was #UNK#
very #UNK#
nice #UNK#
and #UNK#
courteous #UNK#
and #UNK#
obviously #UNK#
chinese #UNK#
. #UNK#

This #UNK#
was #UNK#
, #UNK#
from #UNK#
start #UNK#
to #UNK#
finish #UNK#
, #UNK#
a #UNK#
mind-bogglingly #UNK#
uncomfortable #UNK#
experience #UNK#
. #UNK#

I #UNK#
went #UNK#
here #UNK#
with #UNK#
a #UNK#
friend #UNK#
on #UNK#
a #UNK#
whim #UNK#
, #UNK#
we #UNK#
went #UNK#
someplace #UNK#
else #UNK#
first #UNK#
and #UNK#
couldn't #UNK#
get #UNK#
a #UNK#
table #UNK#
. #UNK#

We #UNK#
concluded #UNK#
with #UNK#
tiramisu #UNK#
chocolate #UNK#

both #UNK#
were #UNK#

Not O

This #UNK#

for #UNK#
the #UNK#
Southglen #UNK#
location #UNK#
which #UNK#

not #UNK#
listed #UNK#
in #UNK#
Citysearch #UNK#

I #UNK#
wish #UNK#
this #UNK#
review #UNK#
would #UNK#
make #UNK#
a #UNK#
difference #UNK#
enough #UNK#
for #UNK#
it #UNK#
to #UNK#
be #UNK#
addressed #UNK#
by #UNK#
management #UNK#
but #UNK#
Snooze #UNK#
has #UNK#
people #UNK#
climbing #UNK#
over #UNK#
each #UNK#
other #UNK#
for #UNK#
a #UNK#
chance #UNK#
to #UNK#
eat #UNK#
at #UNK#
this #UNK#
overpriced #UNK#
restaurant #UNK#
with #UNK#
mediocre #UNK#
food #UNK#
and #UNK#
service #UNK#
, #UNK#
so #UNK#
this #UNK#
review #UNK#
as #UNK#
well #UNK#
as #UNK#
the #UNK#
other #UNK#
negative #UNK#
ones #UNK#
for #UNK#
their #UNK#
Larimer #UNK#

will #UNK#
go #UNK#
unaddressed #UNK#

I'll O
be O
back O
for O

Good O

The O

fresh O

Although #UNK#
we #UNK#
were #UNK#
looking #UNK#
for #UNK#
regular #UNK#
lettuce #UNK#
and #UNK#
some #UNK#
walnuts #UNK#
the #UNK#

we #UNK#
got #UNK#

great #UNK#

We've O
tried O
before O

it O
always O

Beautiful O

And #UNK#
it #UNK#
was #UNK#
quick #UNK#
which #UNK#
is #UNK#
very #UNK#
important #UNK#
. #UNK#

this #UNK#
little #UNK#
place #UNK#
has #UNK#
a #UNK#
cute #UNK#
interior #UNK#
decor #UNK#
and #UNK#
affordable #UNK#
city #UNK#
prices #UNK#
. #UNK#

The #UNK#
location #UNK#
and #UNK#
ambience #UNK#
is #UNK#
Ok #UNK#
but #UNK#
the #UNK#
food #UNK#
is #UNK#
what #UNK#
makes #UNK#
up #UNK#
for #UNK#
it #UNK#
. #UNK#

I #UNK#
literally #UNK#
just #UNK#
got #UNK#
back #UNK#
home #UNK#
after #UNK#
visiting #UNK#
Casa #UNK#
La #UNK#
Femme #UNK#
and #UNK#
was #UNK#
so #UNK#
offended #UNK#
by #UNK#
my #UNK#
visit #UNK#
felt #UNK#
it #UNK#
necessary #UNK#
to #UNK#
try #UNK#
and #UNK#
warn #UNK#
other #UNK#
diners #UNK#
who #UNK#
value #UNK#
their #UNK#
money #UNK#
and #UNK#
time #UNK#
. #UNK#

The #UNK#
place #UNK#
itself #UNK#
is #UNK#
beautiful #UNK#
the #UNK#
bar #UNK#
scene #UNK#
seems #UNK#
to #UNK#
be #UNK#
happening #UNK#
. #UNK#

Also #UNK#
, #UNK#
the #UNK#
sandwiches #UNK#
( #UNK#
nearing #UNK#
$ #UNK#
7 #UNK#
) #UNK#
didn't #UNK#
come #UNK#
with #UNK#
anything #UNK#
like #UNK#
chips #UNK#
or #UNK#
a #UNK#
side #UNK#
. #UNK#

The O
stuff O
tilapia O

horrid O

tasted O
like O
cardboard O

You #UNK#
can #UNK#
easily #UNK#
hear #UNK#
him #UNK#
though #UNK#
so #UNK#
it #UNK#
was #UNK#
a #UNK#
pleasant #UNK#
sound #UNK#
and #UNK#
not #UNK#
overbearing #UNK#
. #UNK#

It's #UNK#
definately #UNK#
not #UNK#
a #UNK#
place #UNK#
to #UNK#
go #UNK#
if #UNK#
you #UNK#
want #UNK#
to #UNK#
impress #UNK#
someone #UNK#
. #UNK#

The #UNK#
lamb #UNK#
was #UNK#
tender #UNK#
so #UNK#
full #UNK#
of #UNK#
flavor #UNK#

the #UNK#

was #UNK#
divine #UNK#

We #UNK#
refused #UNK#
to #UNK#
pay #UNK#
for #UNK#
it #UNK#
because #UNK#
at #UNK#
this #UNK#
point #UNK#
it #UNK#
had #UNK#
nothing #UNK#
to #UNK#
do #UNK#
with #UNK#
the #UNK#
food #UNK#
anymore #UNK#
. #UNK#

The #UNK#
naan #UNK#
was #UNK#
some #UNK#
of #UNK#
the #UNK#
best #UNK#
I've #UNK#
had #UNK#

I #UNK#
really #UNK#
enjoyed #UNK#

Fabulous #UNK#

Single #UNK#
Worst #UNK#
Restaurant #UNK#
in #UNK#
Manhattan #UNK#

Inside #UNK#
is #UNK#
a #UNK#
little #UNK#
cramped #UNK#
, #UNK#
but #UNK#
to #UNK#
be #UNK#
expected #UNK#
. #UNK#

However #UNK#
, #UNK#
they #UNK#
do #UNK#
take #UNK#
your #UNK#

numbers #UNK#
so #UNK#
that #UNK#
you #UNK#
can #UNK#
go #UNK#
hang #UNK#
out #UNK#

they #UNK#

this #UNK#

misstake #UNK#

Not #UNK#
one #UNK#

my #UNK#

called #UNK#

them #UNK#
a #UNK#
heads #UNK#
up #UNK#
that #UNK#
their #UNK#

want #UNK#

check #UNK#
the #UNK#
cleanliness #UNK#
of #UNK#
their #UNK#

I'm #UNK#
glad #UNK#
I #UNK#
was #UNK#
introduced #UNK#
to #UNK#
this #UNK#
place #UNK#
and #UNK#
this #UNK#
is #UNK#
a #UNK#
rare #UNK#
gem #UNK#
in #UNK#
NY #UNK#
. #UNK#

It's #UNK#
a #UNK#
rather #UNK#
cramped #UNK#
and #UNK#
busy #UNK#
restaurant #UNK#
and #UNK#
it #UNK#
closes #UNK#
early #UNK#

The #UNK#
food #UNK#
is #UNK#
fantastic #UNK#

authentic #UNK#

The #UNK#
last #UNK#
two #UNK#
times #UNK#
I #UNK#
ordered #UNK#
from #UNK#
here #UNK#
my #UNK#
food #UNK#
was #UNK#
soo #UNK#
spicy #UNK#
that #UNK#
I #UNK#
could #UNK#
barely #UNK#
eat #UNK#
it #UNK#
, #UNK#
and #UNK#
the #UNK#
spice #UNK#
took #UNK#
away #UNK#
from #UNK#
the #UNK#
flavor #UNK#
of #UNK#
the #UNK#
dish #UNK#
. #UNK#

Quite #UNK#
frankly #UNK#
, #UNK#
this #UNK#
is #UNK#
some #UNK#
of #UNK#
the #UNK#
worst #UNK#
sushi #UNK#
I #UNK#
have #UNK#
ever #UNK#
tried #UNK#
. #UNK#

If #UNK#
I #UNK#
could #UNK#
give #UNK#
0 #UNK#
stars #UNK#
I #UNK#
would #UNK#
do #UNK#
so #UNK#
for #UNK#
this #UNK#
place #UNK#
. #UNK#

I #UNK#
have #UNK#
never #UNK#
before #UNK#
eaten #UNK#
40 #UNK#
pieces #UNK#
of #UNK#
relatively #UNK#
good #UNK#
nigiri #UNK#

When #UNK#
family #UNK#
came #UNK#
in #UNK#
he #UNK#
gave #UNK#
them #UNK#
apps #UNK#

then #UNK#
ordered #UNK#

With #UNK#
the #UNK#
exception #UNK#
of #UNK#
our #UNK#
lemon #UNK#
salad #UNK#
that #UNK#
had #UNK#
so #UNK#
much #UNK#
pepper #UNK#
on #UNK#
it #UNK#
that #UNK#
our #UNK#
eyes #UNK#
started #UNK#
watering #UNK#

the #UNK#

was #UNK#
decent #UNK#

The #UNK#

though #UNK#
pricey #UNK#

Much #UNK#

This #UNK#
is #UNK#
undoubtedly #UNK#
my #UNK#
favorite #UNK#
modern #UNK#
Japanese #UNK#
brasserie #UNK#
( #UNK#
that #UNK#
don #UNK#
’ #UNK#
t #UNK#
serve #UNK#
sushi #UNK#

, #UNK#
and #UNK#
in #UNK#
my #UNK#
opinion #UNK#
, #UNK#
one #UNK#
of #UNK#
the #UNK#
most #UNK#
romantic #UNK#
restaurants #UNK#
in #UNK#
the #UNK#
city #UNK#
! #UNK#

My #UNK#
husband #UNK#
said #UNK#
he #UNK#
could've #UNK#
eaten #UNK#
several #UNK#
more #UNK#
, #UNK#
the #UNK#
portion #UNK#
was #UNK#
fine #UNK#
for #UNK#
me #UNK#
he #UNK#
even #UNK#
exclaimed #UNK#
that #UNK#
the #UNK#
french #UNK#
fries #UNK#
were #UNK#
the #UNK#
best #UNK#
he #UNK#
has #UNK#
had #UNK#
. #UNK#

We #UNK#
asked #UNK#
for #UNK#
sides #UNK#
which #UNK#
the #UNK#
waiter #UNK#
than #UNK#
admitted #UNK#
that #UNK#
he #UNK#
forgot #UNK#
to #UNK#
put #UNK#
in #UNK#
that #UNK#
part #UNK#
of #UNK#
our #UNK#
order #UNK#

I #UNK#
am #UNK#
bringing #UNK#
my #UNK#
whole #UNK#
family #UNK#
back #UNK#
next #UNK#

These O
are O

you O

around O

After #UNK#
dinner #UNK#
the #UNK#
manager #UNK#
grabbed #UNK#
my #UNK#
boyfriend #UNK#
, #UNK#
asked #UNK#
him #UNK#
: #UNK#
Where #UNK#
are #UNK#
you #UNK#
from #UNK#

maybe #UNK#
you #UNK#
dont #UNK#

how #UNK#

in #UNK#
America #UNK#

and #UNK#
in #UNK#
the #UNK#

stormed #UNK#
away #UNK#
almost #UNK#
teareyed #UNK#

that #UNK#
tips #UNK#
are #UNK#
the #UNK#
only #UNK#
thing #UNK#
they #UNK#
survive #UNK#
on #UNK#

It O
was O
well O
worth O
the O
wait O

My #UNK#
husband #UNK#
and #UNK#
I #UNK#
thougt #UNK#
it #UNK#
would #UNK#
be #UNK#
great #UNK#

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-neutral

which O
are O
huge O

loved O
it O

I #UNK#
stumbled #UNK#
upon #UNK#
this #UNK#
great #UNK#
pizzeria #UNK#
as #UNK#
I #UNK#
explored #UNK#
my #UNK#
new #UNK#
neighborhood #UNK#

It #UNK#
? #UNK#

served #UNK#
with #UNK#
either #UNK#
a #UNK#
peppercorn #UNK#

or #UNK#
red #UNK#
wine #UNK#
reduction #UNK#
, #UNK#
though #UNK#
both #UNK#
were #UNK#
indistinguishable #UNK#
in #UNK#
taste #UNK#

The O
food B-positive
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O

We #UNK#
put #UNK#
out #UNK#

were #UNK#
told #UNK#
that #UNK#
it'd #UNK#
be #UNK#
a #UNK#
30 #UNK#
minute #UNK#
wait #UNK#

I #UNK#
do #UNK#
not #UNK#
think #UNK#
dinner #UNK#
in #UNK#
Manhattan #UNK#
should #UNK#
cost #UNK#

400.00 #UNK#

I O
took O
one O

Great O

I #UNK#

imagine #UNK#
you #UNK#
not #UNK#
rushing #UNK#
out #UNK#

there #UNK#

Even O
after O
they O
overcharged O
me O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
. O

We #UNK#
did #UNK#
arrive #UNK#
late #UNK#
for #UNK#
our #UNK#
reservation #UNK#
so #UNK#
I #UNK#
can #UNK#
not #UNK#
complain #UNK#
too #UNK#
much #UNK#
about #UNK#
the #UNK#
wait #UNK#
for #UNK#
a #UNK#

I O
have O
been O
twice O
to O
this O

The O
mussels O
were O
fantastic O

so O
was O
the O
dessert B-negative
... O
definitely O
going O
to O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
. O

Yes O
, O
I O
ate O
the O
food B-positive

I O
certainly O
would O
not O
have O
if O
I O
had O
seen O
the O

I O
was O
at O

I #UNK#
have #UNK#
it #UNK#

, #UNK#
which #UNK#
I #UNK#
would #UNK#
expect #UNK#
at #UNK#
a #UNK#

this #UNK#

For #UNK#
